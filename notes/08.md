# Additional Steps

## Adding FontAwesome to our Task component

Our tutor now takes us on a quick diversion to the land of CDN-hosted libraries -- which they point out we can simply add directly to our ```public/index.html``` file, as one might imagine. But I'd rather use the NPM package so that all of our dependencies are in package.json, and in the hopes that it would be more likely to work with TypeScript. There's even specific instructions for use with Vue.js.

```
yarn add @fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core @fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons @fortawesome/vue-fontawesome@prerelease
```

Now we've got to register our icon component with Vue by changing our main.ts to the following:

(main.ts)
```ts
import  { createApp } from 'vue'
import App from './App.vue'
import { library } from '@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core';
import { faTimes } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons/faTimes'
import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/vue-fontawesome';

library.add(faTimes);

let app = createApp(App)
app.component('font-awesome-times-icon', FontAwesomeIcon)
app.mount('#app')
```

You'll notice that we've separated out the createApp call from the ```mount``` call, so that in between we could register the component with our app.

Now we can use our component in our Task component:

```vue
  <template>
    <div class="task">
      <h3>
        {{task && task.text}}
        <font-awesome-times-icon class="fas" icon="times"/>
      </h3>
      <p>{{ task && task.day }}</p>
    </div>
  </template>
```

And let's make it red by adding some styling in the ```<style/>``` tag:

(components/Task.vue)
```html
<style>
  .fas {
    color: red;
  }
//...
</style>
```

We can also style the component based on whether a reminder is set for this task, based on the style we already added to this component's ```<style/>``` tag:

```vue
  <template>
    <div :class="[task && task.reminder ? 'reminder' : '', 'task']" class="task">
      ...
    </div>
  </template>
```

Looking at the changes to our ```div``` tag -- you can see that the ```:class``` attribute accepts an array of classNames as strings. We're using a ternary statement to determine whether the 'reminder' class appears in addition to our 'task' class, based on whether the task's reminder prop is true.

Save -- now you'll see a green border to the left for tasks whose ```reminder``` prop is set to true.
