# The Task Component

Let's start by creating a ```components/Tasks.vue``` component:

```vue
<template>
  
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent, PropType } from 'vue'
  import { Task } from '../types';

  export default defineComponent({
    name: 'Tasks',
    props: {
      tasks: Array as PropType<Task[]>
    }
  })
</script>
```
Note that we've used the vue PropType generic for the first time in order to type this prop.

Next, add the Tasks component to ```App.vue```:

```vue
<template>
  <!-- ... -->
  <Tasks :tasks="tasks" />
</template>

// ... 
<script lang="ts">
  // ...
  import type { Task } from './types';

  @Options({
    components: {
      Header,
      Tasks
    },
    //...
  })
  //...
</script>
```

### Iterating through the Tasks

We can now loop through the tasks in our Tasks component and display them in our UI. Here's what that looks like:

```vue
<template>
  <div :key="task.id" v-for="task in tasks">
    <h3>{{task.text}}</h3>
  </div>
</template>
```
So the v-for prop lets us define an iterator, and the component it's set on will be repeated for each iteree -- and then we can use the iteree in child components.

We also need to provide a key, much like in React, to keep track of each individual instance of this div.

### Adding a Task Component

We'll carry on doing what now starts to feel routine, and make a new component we'll use to display each task.

```vue
<template>
  <div class="task">
    <h3>{{task && task.text}}</h3>
    <p>{{ task && task.day }}</p>
  </div>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { TaskObject } from "@/types";
import { defineComponent, PropType } from "vue";

  export default defineComponent({
    name: 'Task',
    props: {
      task: {
        type: Object as PropType<TaskObject>
      }
    }
  });

</script>

<style>
  .task {
    background: #f4f4f4;
    margin: 5px;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    cursor: pointer;
  }

  .task.reminder {
    border-left: 5px solid green;
  }

  .task h3 {
    display: flex;
    align-items: center;
    justify-content: space-between;
  }
</style>
```

Nothing very special here at this point -- we've used ```defineComponent``` to create a Task component, we've defined its prop ```task``` using our ```TaskObject``` interface, and we've used that task in our template to display the name and date of each task.

We've also added some styling, courtesy of the tutorial author, who reminds us that we could remove the .task class if we set the ```<style/>``` tag to ```scoped```, and just target the div itself.
