# Building Static Assets for Deployment

Before we swap our pre-defined App state with something more akin to a production backend, let's learn how to build our static assets for deployment.

In the console, stop any running Vue processes, run:

```
% yarn build
```

This will build a 'dist' folder that is ready for deployment to a cloud host. It's a static, single-page application, right now, so no cloud functions or other server-like functionality is going to be required for it to function fully.

Now, you can use a tool like ```serve``` (installed by ```yarn global add serve```) to test your production build:

```
serve -s dist
```

Woila! It works perfectly.
