## Getting started

### Script component

To mount a basic component with data:

```javascript
const app = Vue.createApp({
  data() {
    return {
      firstName: 'John',
      lastName: 'Doe',
      email: "john@ok.com",
      gender: 'male',
      picture: 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/men/10.jpg'
    }
  }
})

app.mount('#app')
```

To use this data on the front-end, we can insert it using ```{{ templatestrings }}``` or as properties using *v-bind:* prefixes. For example:

```html
<img v-bind:src="picture" />
```

What's inside the string is actually going to be processed as JavaScript by Vue. So you can also use a template literal:

```html
<img v-bind:src="picture" v-bind:alt="`${firstName} ${lastName}`"/>
```

A little awkward, but it works.

You can also *shorthand* v-bind: by just using the colon:

```
<img :src="picture" :alt="`${firstName} ${lastName}`"/>
```

This works for class properties, as well, so you can dynamically apply CSS depending on the data injected into the component. This example is cringe, but it is indeed an example. (We can try to make it less cringe later.)

```html
<img :class="gender" v-bind:src="picture" v-bind:alt="`${firstName} ${lastName}`"/>
```

### Handling Actions

To assign an action handler to a component, use a v-on: prefix. For example: ```v-on:click```:

```html
  <button v-on:click="getUser()" :class="gender">Get Random User</button>
```

To provide this method, we can add a ```methods``` property to the object we're passing into ```Vue.createApp()```:

```javascript
{
  // ...data(),
  methods: {
    getUser() {
      console.log(this.firstName);
    }
  }
}
```

You can also mutate state using these methods by using the ```this``` keyword:

```javascript
  {
    // ...data(),
    methods: {
      getUser() {
        this.firstName = 'Sam'
        this.lastName = 'Smith'
        this.email = 'sam@gmail.com'
        this.gender = 'female'
        this.picture = 'https://randomuser.me/api/portraits/women/10.jpg'
      },
    },
  }
```

Clicking the button we've assigned this method to now completely changes the state of the component.

You can also use aync in your component methods:

```javascript
  {
    // ...data(),
    methods: {
      async getUser() {
        const res = await fetch('https://randomuser.me/api');
        const { results } = await res.json();

        this.firstName = results[0].name.first;
        this.lastName = results[0].name.last;
        this.email = results[0].email;
        this.gender = results[0].gender;
        this.picture = results[0].picture.large;
      },
    },
  }
```

Now you can click on the "Get Random User" button and it will update the data. Kind of amazing how much functionality this enables without even installing any tooling at all!
