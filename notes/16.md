# One More Thing: The Computed Property

One thing that isn't yet quite right in our app is that the "Add Task" button appears even in our About view. To avoid this, we'll introduce one last Vue.js concept: the ```computed``` property.

The ```computed``` property is another prop on the component options object. This prop contains methods that are run when their reactive dependencies change -- much like React's useMemo hook, or any other type of automated memoizer. This is useful also for reducing bloat in Vue templates.

And, now that we have the router loaded into our app, every component has a special prop called ```$route```. We can access this prop in methods like those we can place in the ```computed``` property.

So we can combine the two, and conditional rendering bindings in our template, to conditionally render our "Add Task" button, using logic that is limited to the Header component that contains it.

To implement this, add to the Header.vue component a new ```computed``` property, and add to it a function, ```isHomePage```.

(components/Header.vue)
```ts
// ...
  computed: {
    isHomePage() {
      return this.$route.path === '/'
    }
  }
// ...
```

And then add a conditional v-show attribute to our Button component:

(components/Header.vue)
```html
  <Button
    v-show="isHomePage" 
    @btn-click="$emit('toggle-add-task')" 
    :text="showAddTask ? 'Close' : 'Add Task'" 
    :color="showAddTask ? 'red' : 'green'"
  />
```

And that's it for our Tasks app!
