# Template Conditionals

Now that we've got the main logic of our app down pat, let's polish the UI a bit.

## Toggling the Form

First, let's give that Add Task button something useful to do by hiding the form by default. To do this, we'll add a new property to our App ```data()``` method:

```js
// ...
  data() {
    return {
      tasks: [] as TaskObject[],
      showAddTask: false
    }
  },
// ...
```

And now we can move the ```<AddTask>``` component into a _conditional_ div:

```html
  <div class="container">
    <Header title="Task Tracker" />
    <div v-if="showAddTask">
      <AddTask @add-task="addTask" />
    </div>
    <Tasks @toggle-reminder="toggleReminder" @delete-task="deleteTask" :tasks="tasks"/>
  </div>
```

This _v-if_ directive makes the component it's assigned to render conditionally -- and in this case, it renders if ```showAddTask``` is ```true```. We could also use a _v-show_ directive.

Save -- you'll see the form disappear.

Now to activate the "Add Task" button, we just need to emit an event from our Button component. We already created a click handler within it -- ```onClick```. So now we just need to replace the console.log in there, and instead emit an event:

(Button.vue)
```ts
// ...
  onClick() {
    this.$emit('toggle-add-task');   
  }
// ...
```

And then we need to handle that in its parent, Header.vue:

(Header.vue)
```vue
<Button @toggle-add-task="$emit('toggle-add-task')" text="Add Task" color="green"/>
```

And finally, we need to handle this in App.vue:

(App.vue)
```vue
  <Header @toggle-add-task="toggleTaskForm" title="Task Tracker"/>
```

(App.vue)
```ts
 // ...
  methods: {
    toggleTaskForm() {
      this.showAddTask = !this.showAddTask
    },
  // ...
  },
```

And that'll do it. Now the "Add Task" form disappears and reappears when we click "Add Task"! Although, if you think about it, it doesn't make much sense for it to say "Add Task" when the next click will disappear the "Add Task" form. So let's make the button's content contigent on ```showAddTask```, too.

To do that, we'll pass ```showAddTask``` through to our Button component:

(App.vue)
```vue
  <Header @toggle-add-task="toggleTaskForm" title="Task Tracker" :showAddTask="showAddTask"/>
```

And deploy it within our Header. Note that we'll also need to change the _text_ and _color_ props on our Button to v-binds by prefixing _:_, or else the contents of our string will just pass straight into the DOM, rather than being parsed as code.

(Header.vue)
```html
  <Button 
    @toggle-add-task="$emit('toggle-add-task')" 
    :text="!showAddTask ? `Add Task` : `Close`" 
    :color="!showAddTask ? 'green' : 'red'"
  />
```

(Header.vue)
```ts
  // ...
  props: {
    // ...
    showAddTask: Boolean
  },
  // ...
```

And that's all! Now the button text changes and so does its color, depending on whether the Add Task form is open or closed.

Real quick, let's generalize our Button to make its click handler less context-specific. That way, we can re-use the component without any domain modeling conflicts or confusion:

(Button.vue)
```ts
export default defineComponent({
    // ...
    methods: {
      onClick() {
        this.$emit('btn-click')
      }
    }
  });
```

And in Header.vue:

(Header.vue)
```html
  <Button 
    @btn-click="$emit('toggle-add-task')" 
    :text="showAddTask ? 'Close' : 'Add Task'" 
    :color="showAddTask ? 'red' : 'green'"
  />
```

OK, great.
