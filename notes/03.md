## Task-Tracking App Setup

### Scaffolding with the Vue CLI

To set up a full Vue.JS scaffold, we'll use the Vue CLI. I'm installing it globally with yarn, but you can use NPM as well, of course.

```
yarn global add @vue/cli
```

Now, you can run ```vue ui``` or ```vue create [projectname]```. We'll use it to configure a Vue 3 project with TypeScript and Babel.

### Vue Scaffold Overview

- package.json scripts:
  - serve: ```vue-cli-service serve```
  - build: ```vue-cli-service build```

- /main.js
  - js entry point
  - imports App.vue & vue/createApp
  - mounts App.vue to vue entry point (#app by default)

- /App.vue
  - Root component: template, script, and style

- /public
  - root folder to be served
  - favicons
  - index.html w/ vue entry point


### Start dev server

```yarn serve```

### main.js and App.vue

App.vue is the root Vue component. It has the three parts -- template, script, style -- of a standard Vue component. 

main.js is the entry point for our Vue app. It imports Vue's 'createApp' helper and App.vue, and mounts it into the DOM inside the HTML component with the provided id.

#### Importing components

Within the ```<script></script>``` tags, we can import components from files with the .vue extension, such as:

```
import HelloWorld from './components/HelloWorld.vue';
```

And then you can add them to the exported component object with the 'components' key:

```javascript
export default {
  name: 'App',
  components: {
    HelloWorld
  }
}
```

Then, you can use it in the template snippet above, like so:

```
<template>
  <HelloWorld msg="Welcome!"/>
</template>
```

Interestingly, we don't seem to need to use : bindings on our custom component properties, so that's cool.

### Tidy the boilerplate

The first thing we need to do is clear out the HelloWorld component -- remove it from the App.vue file, and then delete components/HelloWorld.vue.

And heck -- let's clear the styles out while we're at it. Here's what we're left with for App.js:

```html
<template>
  <img alt="Vue logo" src="./assets/logo.png">
</template>

<script lang="ts">
import { Options, Vue } from 'vue-class-component';

export default class App extends Vue {}
</script>

<style>
</style>
```

The boilerplate has configured this script with a ```lang="ts"``` prop, and the App class seems to extend a ```Vue``` class. But let's find out what we need to know to make all of this work with TypeScript, before we start making any components.
