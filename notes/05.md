# Continuing to Create Components

Alright -- now that we've got some sense of how to use TypeScript with Vue, let's head back to the tutorial.

## Creating our Vue components

Let's follow the tutorial and create our ```components/Header.vue``` component, adding what we've learned about Vue's TypeScript API:

```vue
<template>
  <header>
    <h1>Task Tracker</h1>
  </header>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import { defineComponent } from 'vue'

  export default defineComponent({
    
  });

</script>

<style>
</style>
```

Note the ```defineComponent``` helper that we learned about in the last section.

Ahh, yes -- the style tag. The tutorial has provided us some styles, both for App.vue and Header.vue. Let's drop those in for now:

/App.vue:
```html
<style>
  @import url('https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Poppins:wght@300;400&display=swap');
  * {
    box-sizing: border-box;
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
  body {
    font-family: 'Poppins', sans-serif;
  }
  .container {
    max-width: 500px;
    margin: 30px auto;
    overflow: auto;
    min-height: 300px;
    border: 1px solid steelblue;
    padding: 30px;
    border-radius: 5px;
  }
  .btn {
    display: inline-block;
    background: #000;
    color: #fff;
    border: none;
    padding: 10px 20px;
    margin: 5px;
    border-radius: 5px;
    cursor: pointer;
    text-decoration: none;
    font-size: 15px;
    font-family: inherit;
  }
  .btn:focus {
    outline: none;
  }
  .btn:active {
    transform: scale(0.98);
  }
  .btn-block {
    display: block;
    width: 100%;
  }
</style>
###

And in /components/Header.vue:
```html
<style scoped>
  header {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: space-between;
    align-items: center;
    margin-bottom: 20px;
  }
</style>
```

(Note the "scoped" attribute on "style" -- this means that the CSS in this tag will apply to elements of the current component only -- very handy for keeping styles linked to the components they're intended for, and making code reuse more effortless.)

Now we'll import our Header component in App.vue:

```html:
<script lang="ts">
  import { Options, Vue } from 'vue-class-component';
  import Header from './components/Header.vue';

  @Options({
    components: {
      Header    
    },
  })

  export default class App extends Vue {}
</script>
```

Note both the import statement, and the fact that Header is added to our exported Components property. (I'm not entirely sure what's going on with the @Options decorator, but the Vue CLI set this file up in this manner. We may want to switch other components to this, but let's see what happens if we leave Header the way it is right now.)

And finally, let's add Header to the template area of App.vue:

```vue
  <template>
    <div class="container">
      <Header title="Task Tracker"/>
    </div>
  </template>
```

You can see that we've given our Header component a custom prop, ```title```. Next, let's learn about how props work in Vue.

### Passing props

Before we explore how props work within the ```<script/>``` tag of a Vue component, let's deploy this title prop in the ```<template/>``` of our ```Header.vue```:

```vue
<template>
  <header>
    <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  </header>
</template>
```

Now, to bring the title into the component. There are multiple ways to define props for a Vue component:

#### Array of prop names

(Header.vue)
```js
export default {
  name: 'Header',
  props: ['title']
}
```

Now, this doesn't look very type-safe, does it? And yet I'm not getting any complaints from the linter here. This makes me a little wary that it's working at all. One place that it's definitely not working is in the ```<template/>``` section of the file, where ```title``` isn't recognized as anything meaningful, apparently. Let's fix that.

_Note -- this part is a bit of a back-and-forth; check the end for the outcome._
OK, after a bit of searching, now I've installed @juit/vue-ts-checker:

```
yarn add @juit-vue-ts-checker --dev
```

And I've added to ```vue.config.js``` the default config options provided by the plugin author:

```
const VueTsCheckerPlugin = require('@juit/vue-ts-checker').VueTsCheckerPlugin

module.exports = {
  chainWebpack: (config) => {
    // We don't need the "fork-ts-checker" plugin anymore, as "vue-ts-checker"
    // also checks all of the TypeScript included in each compilation!
    config.plugins.delete('fork-ts-checker')

    // Let the "vue-ts-checker" plugin take care of checking Vue and TypeScript
    config.plugin('vue-ts-checker').use(new VueTsCheckerPlugin())
  }
}
```

This doesn't include the webpack configuration offered by the Vue docs, so we might need to add those...

Yep. Restarting the dev server yields the following error:

```
ERROR  TypeError: The 'compilation' argument must be an instance of Compilation
TypeError: The 'compilation' argument must be an instance of Compilation
```

OK -- let's rewind. Removing these changes and the vue-ts-checker package, and re-Googling this.

*returns 5 minutes later*

It turns out the Vue community has actually experienced a fair amount of difficulty in type-checking Vue templates, per [this post](http://www.myriptide.com/vue-type-check/):

```
Nowadays more people start trying to build Vue project with Typescript. Vue itself also provides better support to Typescript such as the vue-class-component lib and rewriting version 3.0's codebase in Typescript.

But the limitation of type checking in the template is still a big problem preventing Vue component from being type-safe.
```

A little more Googling later, I've found that the VSCode plugin ```vetur```, which we are using, has two experimental options to enable typechecking templates. Let's set them both:

```
vetur.experimental.templateInterpolationService: true
vetur.validation.templateProps
```

OK! There we go. Now, hovering over {{ title }} tells us: ```(property) title: any```. So indeed, notating our props this way is not TypeSafe. Finally, we can get back to the tutorial!


#### Defining Props as an object

You can instead supply a configuration object, letting you explicitly define a type for a given prop:

(Header.vue)
```js
export default defineComponent({
  name: 'Header',
  props: {
    title: String
  }
})
```

Nice! Now hovering over ```{{title}}``` in the ```<template/>``` shows us: ```(property) title?: string```.

TypeScript even knows that we haven't indicated that ```title``` is a mandatory prop for this component (although it's interesting that it's now letting me know that App.js is missing the "title" prop, which seems inconsistent!) How can we change that?

Well, we can go a step further and define the prop as an object containing a default value:

```js
export default defineComponent({
  name: 'Header',
  props: {
    title: {
      type: String,
      default: 'Hello World'
    }
  }
})
```

Now that we've made this change, ```{{ title }}``` no longer gets a ? in our type-checker, since we know that it will have some value even if not defined in the parent component. 

Strangely, the typechecker is still chastising our App.vue component for not supplying this title prop to Header -- something we'll need to keep an eye on.

Anyhow, reloading the page, we can see our "Hello World" headline inside a box, just as we've defined. We'll actually give the Header component a title, though, since we have one:

(App.vue)
```
<Header title="Task Tracker"/>
```

Save -- hot reload, looks good.

### Adding a Button and Handling a Click Event

Let's add a Button component, since we'll need to place multiple buttons in our Todo list UI. There'll be a few new things in here.

(components/Button.vue)
```vue
<template>
  <button :style="{background: color}" class="btn">{{ text }}</button>
</template>

<script lang="ts">
  import Vue from 'vue'
  export default Vue.extend({
    name: 'Button',
    props: {
      text: String
      color: String
    }
  })
</script>

<style></style>
```

Let's break down the new stuff:

First, ```:style="{[css prop]: [variable]}"``` is an interesting way to define per-component styles. I wonder if using the : sigil means that this works on custom components without needing to pass a style prop through to an underlying native HTML component.

The style prop seems to just be an object literal -- a CSS style name as the key, and the value as a property. I assume we can't use hyphens in there, so there may be camelcase style prop names, as in React?

Anyway, we're also assigning the "btn" class so that the global styles we already copped for App.js apply to this button. We don't need to add any other styles just yet.

Let's add some buttons to our header:

```vue
<template>
  <header>
    <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
    <Button text="Add Task" color="green"/>
  </header>
</template>
```

```ts
  //...
  import Button from './Button.vue';

  export default defineComponent({
    //...
    components: {
      Button
    }
  })
```

Great!

Let's add an event to the Button component now:

(components/Header.vue)
```vue
<template>
  <button v-on:click="onClick()" :style="{background: color}" class="btn">{{ text }}</button>
</template>
```
Again, this is JS code being provided to this component as a string, which is interesting.

There is actually a shorthand for this ```v-on:``` prefix: the ```@``` sign:

(components/Header.vue)
```vue
<template>
  <button @click="onClick()" :style="{background: color}" class="btn">{{ text }}</button>
</template>
```

And we'll define the handler as a "method" in our object literal:

(components/Header.vue)
```vue
<script lang="ts">
  //...
  export default defineComponent({
    //...,
    methods: {
      onClick(): {
        console.log('click');
      }
    }
    //....
  })
  //...
</script>
```

OK! Click on the "Add Task" button and you'll see "click" printed to the console.
