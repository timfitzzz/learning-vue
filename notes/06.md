# Handling Data

## Getting Data

Usually, data will come from a backend, but for now we'll put data inside the App.vue file -- right at the root of our Vue component "options" object.

We'll also introduce our first Vue lifecycle method: ```created```. This method executes when the component is created as part of our Vue program.

(App.vue)
```ts
  import { Options, Vue } from 'vue-class-component';
  import Header from './components/Header.vue';
  import type { Task } from './types';

  @Options({
    components: {
      Header    
    },
    data() {
      return {
        tasks: [] as Task[],
      }
    },
    created() {
      this.tasks = [
        {
          "id": "1",
          "text": "Doctors Appointment",
          "day": "March 5th at 2:30pm",
          "reminder": true
        },
        {
          "id": "2",
          "text": "Meeting with boss",
          "day": "March 6th at 1:30pm",
          "reminder": true
        },
        {
          "id": "3",
          "text": "Food shopping",
          "day": "March 7th at 2:00pm",
          "reminder": false
        }
      ]
    }
  })

  export default class App extends Vue {}
```

So what's happening above?

- the ```data()``` method is letting Vue know that it should keep track of a 'tasks' array
- the ```created()``` lifecycle method runs when the component mounts, and provides the array of tasks to the Vue component for addition into the 'tasks' array.

For type safety, we have deviated from the tutorial a bit by adding a ```types.ts``` file and typing the Task object, and then importing that type for use in typing the return of our ```data()``` method. That file:

```ts
export interface Task {
  id: string
  text: string
  day: string
  reminder: boolean
}
```

Now we'll create a Task component that can display these tasks in our app.
